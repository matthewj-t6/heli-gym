# heli-gym üöÅ
OpenAI GYM environment for 6-DOF Helicopter simulation.

This is GYM environment package for reinforcement learning for helicopter flight tasks using minimum complexity helicopter model.

## Environment Details

* Pure Gym environment
* Realistic Dynamic Model based on Minimum Complexity Helicopter Model ([Heffley and Mnich](https://robertheffley.com/docs/Sim_modeling/Heffley-Mnich--Minimum-Complexity%20Helicopter%20Simulation%20Math%20Model--NASA%20CR%20177476.pdf))
In addition, inflow dynamics are added and model is adjusted so that it covers multiple flight conditions. 
* Rendering is done by OpenGL.

## Tasks
For now only one task is available. 

| Environment        | Details              |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| HeliHover-v0       | Hovering Task        |

## Setup
Run following command.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Create environment by either,
```python
from heligym import HeliHover
env = HeliHover()
```
or
```python
import gym
import heligym
env = gym.make("HeliHover-v0")
```

The rest is usual as of any GYM environment !
